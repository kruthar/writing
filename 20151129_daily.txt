Moving day. After years of cramped apartment living with his lovable, but unhygenic roommates, Josh was finally getting
his own place. It was a small place, red brick with a front facing kitchen window. Under the front window were a few
withering bushes, I'll have to replace those, Josh thought as he carried a box of books up to the front door.

"Where do you want these babe?" asked Carol, gesturing to a box with Video Games scrawled on the side.

"In the living room, I need to get a shelf or something for those."

"Ya, how does it fel to be an adult? You'll actually have to buy some furniture." Carol turned to head inside. Josh
couldn't help but stare for a moment. She had come to help unpack his things dressed in the tight shorts he liked and
her hair tied down in a red bandana. Josh always liked it when she dressed for manual labor.

Josh and Carol, with the help of Josh's former roommates Bill and Cory trekked back and forth from moving van to house
carrying boxes and the meager amounts of furniture that belonged to Josh. It didn't take long, Josh had never lived on
his own and always relied on communal use of furniture and appliances. After they were finished Josh ordered the
obligatory pizzas and made a beer run to the corner store down the street. Beer and pizza were the only way he got
convince Bill and Cory to lend a hand, they were still a little sore about having to pick up extra rent now that Josh
was moved out.

In the end it was all laughs, hugs and handshakes as the guys headed home.

"Maybe I should stay here and help you break the place in," Carol whisperd to Josh as he shut the door. She wrapped an
arm around his waste and kissed him lightly on the neck.

"Maybe you should," he said, turning and kissing her back hard on the mouth. He pressed her back against the wall of the
foyer and raised his hand to caress her cheek.

"To the bedroom, Romeo" she said. She bit her lip and started to prance to the bedroom. The bedroom was almost bare. A
few boxes of his books adorned the corner still packed. His bed was just a mattress, unsupported in the middle of the
room. Josh had not even unpacked the sheets to cover it, but it didn't matter. The maid love in the bare room and to
Josh, life seemed better then ever.
